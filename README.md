# PicoPlaca
#Example of a Pico Y Placa validator. The structure is distributed between a view(picoplacaformvw.php), which calls a controller (picoplaca_ctl.php) and finally it calls a model(picoplaca_mdl.php).
#The View just contains the html and the form to register the information needed, the controller handles the logic and the model acces to the data.
